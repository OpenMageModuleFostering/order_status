    <summary>This extension adds extra Status options to the Order Status drop down of Customer Orders and also allows you to add your own.</summary>
    <description>We all know that Magento is lacking in the order status department, and I have searched the forum wide and have come up with a package that works.

Credits go to:
Spheric, Atlasit, Ajayksh, Erenaud

Spheric is the one who created the module. I just stuck it into a package and added a variety of customs Status's which most people should find useful without changing.

Below is the list of New Status's that have been added:

 * Pending - Credit Card Reserved
 * Pending - Stock has been ordered
 * Pending - Proof of Payment Received
  
 * Processing - Payment has Cleared
 * Processing - Credit Card has been Settled
 * Processing - Stock has been received and scanned
 * Processing - Stock has been invoiced, packaged and awaiting courier
 * Processing - Stock has been invoiced, packaged and ready to be posted
 * Processing - Stock is ready and awaiting collection
  
 * Complete - Courier has collected
 * Complete - Stock has been posted
 * Complete - Stock has been collected
  
 * Cancelled - As per Customer Request
 * Cancelled - Customer not Responding
 * Cancelled - Stock Item Discontinued
 * Cancelled - Suspected Fraud
  
 * Back Order

To add your own Status's you can edit the following file:
magento_root/app/code/local/sales/local/etc/config.xml

Just follow the istructions of the grey text in that file.</description>
